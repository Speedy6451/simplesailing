The next great period of piracy was the Middle Ages. In the 12th and 13th centuries trade in Europe was growing rapidly offering rich pickings for pirates. The English Channel was infested with pirates many of them operating from the Cinque Ports, Dover, Hastings, Hythe, Romney, and Sandwich. There were also pirates operating from ports like Dunkirk and Calais. There were also many pirates in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.
